# Aircast

## Description

This docker container will make Chromecast devices available to Apple devices
using Airplay.

This container is a small wrapper around [AirConnect](https://github.com/philippe44/AirConnect)

The main use would be to run this on a linux box (Pi, Synology) with host networking.
